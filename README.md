# Week2NBSChallenge
### What was the challenge?
Creating a shop database, creating and adding data to the tables, and querying the tables.

### How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to be tricky, as I knew that we had covered some complex concepts in SQL and I was not sure what we were going to be asked to do.

### What went well?
I was able to work with other TDPers and help out with what others were stuck on.

### What didn't go as planned?
The tasks were exceptionally tricky, even for someone who has used SQL in the past. 
I worked on the task a lot on thursday night, but because of how the VMs work, on friday morning I had to redownload everything and recreate everything I had worked on the previos night which added to the difficulty of the task. 
I am very happy I managed to complete all the (revised) required and stretch tasks, but I did need to reach out to my network for help from buddies and friends.

### Possible improvements for future challenges
We ended up having to cut this task short, removing a lot of the tasks & stretch tasks due to the complexity of the tasks (which was great!).
